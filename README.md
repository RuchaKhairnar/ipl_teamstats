# ipl_teamstats

Cricket is a game of skill and timming but affecting the games outcome is surely possible with some good old analysis. I have prepared an algorithm which calculates the average run scored in an over in the specified year frames. The function takes arguments Team_name, Start_year and End_year and returns a graph with the trend of average of scored runs over the specified year in a particular over and plot it using a customised ggtheme background.
